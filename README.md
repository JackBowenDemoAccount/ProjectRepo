# ProjectRepo
Our code asks for the users name and age, and then tells them how many years they have to wait until they are 100 years old.
Our project is intended to be two-fold. It's a project written using excusively python, and can be accessed at Lab-Exercises-1.ipynb. The project initially requests the users name, followed then by the request of the users age. The name can be inputted into a custom response, but the age value is immediately plugged into an equation which then prints out the number of years that person must wait until they are 100 years old. This could then be expanded on and asking for day, month and year of birth, the equation can then determine how many years and days remain until that person reaches 100 years of age, accounting of course for leap year additions. The project's code of conduct details the process of people modifying/adding to the code and the rules by which they must follow in order to add to the code. The license we are using for this project essentially makes it fully open-source and should you desire to read more you can just go to LICENSE.md file for additional information. Thank you!
